                    	<p>For LOYAL3 partners, they are provided data about their investors through an analytics portal. This consists of roughly 15 different charts ranging from number of investors to geographic and census information to the NPS for that company.</p>

                    	<h3>Process</h3>
                    	<p>I started with creating a sticky note for each chart and began to group them into logical groupings that would form the navigation. I moved to drawing each chart out on paper, lots of paper, to make sure I understood exactly the best way to display it. Once confident I was headed in the right direction, I began making the designs digital. After many reviews and iterations, we finalized the information architecture, interaction design, chart display, and visual design.</p>

            	<h2 class="section-title">Dashboard: The Evolution</h2>
                <p class="description">We started with the concept of a dashboard where someone who logs in can quickly get an overview of the most important numbers estimating visits would be frequent and short. However, after talks with potential customers, their usage of the analytics portal was projected to be infrequent but lengthy visits. Users would have time to dive deep into the numbers at each visit. This led us to scrap the dashboard and reorganize the data around three key data points: investors, shares, and loyalty. Below, you'll see how the dashboard evolved and that the characteristics of those designs carried over to the final version.</p>

                <h3>Initial Version of Navigation</h3>
                <p class="description">The analytics content was broken down into five different categories each themed after the project goals.</p>
            	<img src="images/L3Portal/issuer_nav1.png" alt="issuer nav initial version" />
                <h3>Iteration</h3>
                <p class="description">Added the ability for the user to logout and edit the profile information. Moved the primary navigation to a separate line and added useful icons.</p>
                <img src="images/L3Portal/issuer_nav2.png" alt="issuer nav version 2" />
                <h3>Final Navigation</h3>
                <p class="description">Simplified the navigation by reorganizing the content into more logical groups that are easier to understand what's contained in them rather than according to our project goals. Allowed us to highlight the most important data - number of investors, number of shares held, and the loyalty rating. Also removed the dashboard (described above) and moved that information to the top of each tab.</p>

            	<h2 class="section-title">Final Designs</h2>
                <p class="description">The analytics portal evolved significantly over time after gathering data from potential customers and talks with the internal team. One of the big concerns with the previous versions was the lack of engagement. The portal was more of a passive experience. To make it more of an active experience, I designed a way for customers to set goals and see how those are projected over time. It gives them tools to see how the actions they take affect the goal numbers.</p>
