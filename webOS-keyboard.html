                    	<h3>What is this?</h3>
                    	<p>When webOS went from using a physical keyboard to a digital keyboard, I needed to design all aspects related to it. This meant establishing how the keyboard interacted with system elements (e.g. textfields), designing how the actual keyboard worked in QWERTY, QWERTZ, and AZERTY, and also defining text correction rules.</p>

                    	<h3>My Role</h3>
                    	<p>For this digital keyboard, I was the design lead and interaction designer. I worked with usability team to test the wireframes, the visual designer to make it beautiful, and with the lead developer on a daily basis to make tweaks as things got built.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-title">Initial Version</h2>
                    <div class="description">
                        <p>The initial design of the keyboard focused on being as familiar as possible with what users are accustomed to in physical keyboards. So unlike other virtual keyboards, I added a number row. This eliminates a lot of switching between multiple keyboard modes to find keys. Almost every key is available to the user without needing to switch keyboard states.</p>

                    <div class="description">
                        <p>After usability testing the initial design of the keyboard, I found that people ignored the key to the left of the spacebar, but found the layout to be very useful.</p>
                    	<p>I added a tab key as a way to either insert a tab or navigate between next and previous textfields just as a physical keyboard works.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-title">Final Design</h2>
                    <div class="description">
                        <p>In the final version, I worked with the visual designer to add in the visual styles as well as make some minor tweaks. One notable tweak was to make the enter button be text rather than a symbol. We found that users were confusing that button with the delete button.</p>
                    	<p>Additionally, but not shown here, we added in the AZERTY and QWERTZ designs for international users, as well as defining which additional symbols would appear on each key upon a press and hold.</p>
